### Database Implementation: Banking and Financial Service Management System

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a robust database management system for a bank that will improve the efficiency of banking operations and provide a seamless experience for customers. 

The goal of this system is to create a database model that will enable the organization to efficiently manage information related to various services offered to customers at specific bank branches

## Design Document
* [Design Document](https://github.com/hazellobo/Banking-and-Financial-Service-Management/blob/main/Database%20Design%20and%20Initial%20ERD.pdf)

* [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/hazellobo/Banking-and-Financial-Service-Management/blob/main/Final%20ERD.pdf) to provide an overview of the database structure

## Dashboard

## To accomplish this goal, the project includes the following components
1. A script for dropping tables, functions, constraints, and procedures

2. Scripts for creating 16 tables

3. Scripts for inserting data into the tables

4. Computation of columns and table level constraint check, such as calculating credit status based on a customer's credit score and preventing a person with the same name and social security number from registering multiple times

5. Triggers and procedures for handling loan, insurance, card, and account transactions, as well as updating account balances

6. Encryption of sensitive customer information for privacy and security

7. Views to show the no. of services provided at each bank branch and to categorize account holders as minors, seniors, and adults to calculate discounts and offers 
   * The view that shows the no. of services provided at each bank branch provides valuable information to the bank management team. It enables them to monitor the       usage of various banking services across different branches, which can help with decision-making related to staffing, resource allocation, and service               offerings        
   * The view that categorizes account holders based on age allows the bank to offer customized discounts and promotions to different age groups. For example, they       can offer special savings account interest rates or credit card rewards to seniors or offer discounts on banking fees to minors. This can help the bank               attract and retain customers in different age groups, thereby increasing customer loyalty and revenue

The creation of views enhances the bank's ability to track usage patterns and provide customized offerings to their customers, thereby improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. Overall, this project aims to provide a reliable, efficient, and secure database management system that will enhance the banking experience for both customers and employees.
