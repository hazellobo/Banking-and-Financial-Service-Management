# Data Management and Database Design


## Project title - Banking and Financial Service Management System

## Project details

Why is Banking and Financial Service Management?

- Before the database was built, employees in the bank had to manually write and store the banking records inside the files. This procedure is highly redundant, arduous and inefficient, especially while retrieving the important information. Therefore, a strong, robust database management system must be made to address this issue.
- The main goal of our system is to design a database model such that it’ll help the organization with information of various services opted by the customers from a particular bank branch and help the bank employees to have a smooth experience for providing additional services
